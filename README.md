# Running App

### A web application to track running progress.

Web app can be accessed at:<br>
https://running-app-tanson.herokuapp.com/<br>
or<br>
https://tansonlee-running-app.glitch.me

My first fullstack project. Front-end made with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Back-end made with Node.js and eEpress. Database made with nedb. Deployed to Heroku and Glitch.

Online app which tracks several measures for a run.
* total distance
* total time
* pace
* date

App contains a database for persistance for usage across several sessions
